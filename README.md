# 3-D localization based on Magnetic field



This is my Master thesis, supervised by **Sizhen Bian**, at the group **Embedded Intelligence** of DFKI.
## Physical Background

## Devices 


| device | img | description |
| :----: | :--------: | :-----: |
| Transmitter | <div align=center><img src="./figure/transmitter.png" width=250></div> | with 3 axes |
| Receiver (with IMU)| <div align=center><img src="./figure/IMU.png" width=250></div> | IMU+beacon+receiver |
| Ultra Sound| <div align=center><img src="./figure/Ultrasound.png" width=250></div> | Mavelmind navigation system, precise 5 cm  |



## Data
We collected data both **indoor** and **outdoor**. The indoor data is at the second floor in DFKI Kaiserslautern, and outdoor data at the entrance of the DFKI. We deployed the 3 transmitters, **T1**, **T2**, and **T3** at 3 vertices of a **Equilateral triangle**, with each edge of length 3.5m, and fixed the 3 ultrasound devices. Finally, the receiver (IMU and Ultrasound embedded) is fixed at the top of a cart. By moving the cart within the Equilateral triangle area, we can collect the mag data and it's corresponding 3D coordinates simultaneously in difeerent height.

## Approach
### 1. Preprocessing
* **Detecting** each period.
* **Filtering out** the noise, picking up the peak mag point generated by each transmitter.

* **Interpolating** the ultrasound data, since these two sensors have different frequence, the data will be more smooth after interpolation.
* **Feature Selection** Designing the best fitted features for specific models.
* **Normalizing** the data, feeding the data to the model.



### 2. Model
Several models could be used in predicting the coordinates in 3D space, in this project, we tested both physical and machine-learning models.  
 
* Physical model

* Machine Learning model  
  - Random Forest 
  - K-Nearest Neighboor
  - Gradient Boosting regression
  - MLP
  - AdaBoost regression
  
### 3. Outlier Detection
Due to the **robustness** problem, sometimes the returned results from machine-learning based model are shifted  away from the ground truth. Outlier detection was used to solve it. Taking a time period as a batch (1.2s, for instance), which should contain 10 predictions, and using outlier detection to filter out these inaccurate ones. The common used methods are:

- **Isolation Forest**
- One-class SVM
- Local outlier Factor
- Robust Covariance

### 4. Dead Reckoning
Dead Reckoning is a method to calculate the current position based on previously determined position. In our cases, given the **previous position** and **velocity**, we can take advantage the data from **IMU**, from which we can get **acceleration and eular angles** of each axis. 
### 4. Kalman Filter 
Kalman Filter is used to fuse the result from Dead Reckoning and the predictions from the model (physical or machine learning model). 
###  5.Data fusion
